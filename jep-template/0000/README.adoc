== Abstract

Audit Log Plugin introduces a standardized way for creating an audit log of Jenkins and plugins using Apache Log4j Audit. The plugin contains predefined audit events to configure it along with any additional extension points or upstream Jenkins Core modifications to support auditing.

== Specification

Audit Log Plugin lays the foundation and provides an unifying way for easily instrumenting more subsystems and plugins with audit logs.

It has predefined audit events that are very common in the Jenkins scenario. It uses Apache Log4j Audit and thus contains a `log4j2.xml` file that allows more complex audit logging configurations. Also the destination of logs can be modified according to the user requirement using a configuration UI.

.Available Audit events:
* User creation
* User login
* User logout
* User property changes
* Start of the build


== Motivation

Audit Log Plugin helps to keep a log of who performed particular Jenkins related operations along with the events happening around that. While this type of feature is addressed by other existing plugins, there is no unifying way for plugins to contribute their own actions.

== Reasoning

[Questions?]
The Jenkins core modification part comes here, is it?

== Backwards Compatibility



== Security



== Infrastructure Requirements



== Testing



== Prototype Implementation
